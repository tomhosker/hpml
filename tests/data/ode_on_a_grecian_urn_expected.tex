\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
Thou still unravished bride of quietness,\\*
\vin Thou foster-child of silence \& slow time,\\
Sylvan historian, who canst thus express\\
\vin A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme:\\
What leaf-fring'd legend haunts about thy shape\\
\vin Of deities or mortals, or of both,\\
\vin \vin In \textsc{Tempe} or the dales of \textsc{Arcady}?\\
\vin What men or gods are these? What maidens loth?\\
What mad pursuit? What struggle to escape?\\*
\vin \vin What pipes \& timbrels? What wild ecstasy?\\!

Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard\\*
\vin Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on;\\
Not to the sensual ear, but, more endeared,\\
\vin Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone:\\
Fair youth, beneath the trees, thou canst not leave\\
\vin Thy song, nor ever can those trees be bare;\\
\vin \vin Bold lover, never, never canst thou kiss,\\
Though winning near the goal yet, do not grieve;\\
\vin She cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss,\\*
\vin \vin For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair.\\!

Ah, happy, happy boughs! that cannot shed\\*
\vin Your leaves, nor ever bid the spring adieu;\\
And, happy melodist, unwearied,\\
\vin For ever piping songs for ever new;\\
More happy love, more happy, happy love,\\
\vin For ever warm \& still to be enjoyed,\\
\vin \vin For ever panting, and for ever young;\\
All breathing human passion far above,\\
\vin That leaves a heart high-sorrowful \& cloyed,\\*
\vin \vin A burning forehead, \& a parching tongue.\\!

Who are these coming to the sacrifice?\\*
\vin To what green altar, O mysterious priest,\\
Lead'st thou that heifer lowing at the skies,\\
\vin And all her silken flanks with garlands drest?\\
What little town by river or sea shore,\\
\vin Or mountain-built with peaceful citadel,\\
\vin \vin Is emptied of this folk, this pious morn?\\
And, little town, thy streets for evermore\\
\vin Will silent be; and not a soul to tell\\*
\vin \vin Why thou art desolate, can e'er return.\\!

O attic shape! Fair attitude! with brede\\*
\vin Of marble men \& maidens overwrought,\\
With forest branches \& the trodden weed;\\
\vin Thou, silent form, dost tease us out of thought\\
As doth eternity: cold pastoral,\\
\vin When old age shall this generation waste,\\
\vin \vin Thou shalt remain, in midst of other woe\\
Than ours, a friend to man, to whom thou say'st,\\
\vin `Beauty is truth, truth beauty -- that is all\marginnote{\footnotesize John 18.38}\\*
\vin \vin Ye know on earth, \& all ye need to know.'
\end{verse}
