In South Australia I was born,
##MINICHORUS Heave away! Haul away!
In South Australia round #PLACE{Cape Horn}.
##MINICHORUS We're bound for South Australia!

###CHORUS
Haul away, you rolling king!
Heave away! Haul away!
Haul away! O hear me sing:
We're bound for South Australia!

As I walked out one morning fair,
There I met Miss #PERSON{Nancy Blair}.

There ain't but one thing grieves my mind:
To leave Miss #PERSON{Nancy Blair} behind.

I ran her all night; I ran her all day,
Ran her before we sailed away.

I shook her up; I shook her down;
I shook her round #ADD round #ADD round.

O when we lollop around #PLACE{Cape Horn},
##MINICHORUS Heave away! Haul away!
You'll wish to God you'd never been born.
##MINICHORUS We're bound for South Australia!

###CHORUS
Haul away, you rolling king!
Heave away! Haul away!
Haul away! O hear me sing:
We're bound for South Australia!
