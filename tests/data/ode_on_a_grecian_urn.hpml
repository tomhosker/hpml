Thou still unravished bride of quietness,
##TAB Thou foster-child of silence and slow time,
Sylvan historian, who canst thus express
##TAB A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme:
What leaf-fring'd legend haunts about thy shape
##TAB Of deities or mortals, or of both,
##TAB ##TAB In #PLACE{Tempe} or the dales of #PLACE{Arcady}?
##TAB What men or gods are these? What maidens loth?
What mad pursuit? What struggle to escape?
##TAB ##TAB What pipes and timbrels? What wild ecstasy?

Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard
##TAB Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on;
Not to the sensual ear, but, more endeared,
##TAB Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone:
Fair youth, beneath the trees, thou canst not leave
##TAB Thy song, nor ever can those trees be bare;
##TAB ##TAB Bold lover, never, never canst thou kiss,
Though winning near the goal yet, do not grieve;
##TAB She cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss,
##TAB ##TAB For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair!

Ah, happy, happy boughs! that cannot shed
##TAB Your leaves, nor ever bid the spring adieu;
And, happy melodist, unwearied,
##TAB For ever piping songs for ever new;
More happy love! more happy, happy love!
##TAB For ever warm and still to be enjoyed,
##TAB ##TAB For ever panting, and for ever young;
All breathing human passion far above,
##TAB That leaves a heart high-sorrowful and cloyed,
##TAB ##TAB A burning forehead, and a parching tongue.

Who are these coming to the sacrifice?
##TAB To what green altar, O mysterious priest,
Lead'st thou that heifer lowing at the skies,
##TAB And all her silken flanks with garlands drest?
What little town by river or sea shore,
##TAB Or mountain-built with peaceful citadel,
##TAB ##TAB Is emptied of this folk, this pious morn?
And, little town, thy streets for evermore
##TAB Will silent be; and not a soul to tell
##TAB ##TAB Why thou art desolate, can e'er return.

O attic shape! Fair attitude! with brede
##TAB Of marble men and maidens overwrought,
With forest branches and the trodden weed;
##TAB Thou, silent form, dost tease us out of thought
As doth eternity: cold pastoral!
##TAB When old age shall this generation waste,
##TAB ##TAB Thou shalt remain, in midst of other woe
Than ours, a friend to man, to whom thou say'st,
##TAB `Beauty is truth, truth beauty -- that is all
##TAB ##TAB Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.'
