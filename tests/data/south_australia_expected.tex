\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
In South Australia I was born,\\*
\vin \textit{Heave away! Haul away!}\\
In South Australia round \textsc{Cape Horn}.\\*
\vin \textit{We're bound for South Australia!}\\!

{\itshape
Haul away, you rolling king!\\
Heave away! Haul away!\\
Haul away! O hear me sing:\\*
We're bound for South Australia!}\\!

As I walked out one morning fair,\\*
There I met Miss \textit{Nancy Blair}.\\!

There ain't but one thing grieves my mind:\\*
To leave Miss \textit{Nancy Blair} behind.\\!

I ran her all night; I ran her all day,\\*
Ran her before we sailed away.\\!

I shook her up; I shook her down;\\*
I shook her round \& round \& round.\\!

O when we lollop around \textsc{Cape Horn},\\*
\vin \textit{Heave away! Haul away!}\\
You'll wish to God you'd never been born.\\*
\vin \textit{We're bound for South Australia!}\\!

{\itshape
Haul away, you rolling king!\\
Heave away! Haul away!\\
Haul away! O hear me sing:\\*
We're bound for South Australia!}
